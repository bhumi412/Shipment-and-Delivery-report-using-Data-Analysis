# Shipment and Delivery Report Dashboard â€“ Data Analysis Project
## Tools Used: Power BI, Excel

Designed and developed an interactive dashboard to analyze key shipment and delivery performance indicators. The dashboard tracked metrics such as delivery time, shipment status, regional performance, and delay reasons, enabling stakeholders to filter data by region, shipment type, and time period. By cleaning and transforming raw data using Excel and visualizing insights through Power BI, the project improved operational transparency and helped identify bottlenecks in the logistics process, ultimately enhancing data-driven decision-making.
